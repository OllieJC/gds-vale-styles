# GDS A-Z style guide GOV.UK

This content was copied on 3 Oct 2019 from https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style

## Abbreviations and acronyms

The first time you use an abbreviation or acronym explain it in full on each page unless it’s well known, like UK, DVLA, US, EU, VAT and MP. This includes government departments or schemes. Then refer to it by initials, and use acronym Markdown so the full explanation is available as hover text.

If you think an acronym is well known, please provide evidence that 80% of the UK population will understand and commonly use it. Evidence can be from search analytics or testing of a representative sample.

Do not use full stops in abbreviations: BBC, not B.B.C.

## Active voice
Use the active rather than passive voice. This will help us write concise, clear content.

## Addressing the user
Address the user as ‘you’ where possible. Content on the site often makes a direct appeal to citizens and businesses to get involved or take action: ‘You can contact HMRC by phone and email’ or ‘Pay your car tax’, for example.

## Americanisms
Do not use Americanisms. You fill in a form, not fill out a form.

Exceptions include where it’s part of a specific name: 4th Mechanized Brigade, for example.

Use the -ise rather than -ize suffix: organise not organize, for example (this is not actually an Americanism but is often seen as such).

## Bank details
When adding bank details in content about paying a government body:

use spaces rather than hyphens in sort codes - 60 70 80 (not 60-70-80)
do not use spaces in account numbers - 10025634

## Brackets
Use (round brackets), not [square brackets]. The only acceptable use of square brackets is for explanatory notes in reported speech:

“Thank you [Foreign Minister] Mr Smith.”

Do not use round brackets to refer to something that could either be singular or plural, like ‘Check which document(s) you need to send to DVLA.’

Always use the plural instead, as this will cover each possibility: ‘Check which documents you need to send to DVLA.’

## bold
Only use bold to refer to text from interfaces in technical documentation or instructions.

You can use bold to explain what field a user needs to fill in on a form, or what button they need to select. For example: “Select Continue. The Verify Certificate window opens.”

Use bold sparingly - using too much will make it difficult for users to know which parts of your content they need to pay the most attention to.

Do not use bold in other situations, for example to emphasise text.

To emphasise words or phrases, you can:

front-load sentences
use headings
use bullets
borough council
Lower case except in a name: Northampton Borough Council.

## Italics
Do not use italics. Use ‘single quotation marks’ if referring to a document, scheme or initiative.

## Bullet points and steps
You can use bullet points to make text easier to read. Make sure that:

you always use a lead-in line
the bullets make sense running on from the lead-in line
you use lower case at the start of the bullet
you do not use more than one sentence per bullet point - use commas or dashes to expand on an item
you do not put ‘or’ or ‘and’ after the bullets
you do not make the whole bullet a link if it’s a long phrase
you do not put a semicolon at the end of a bullet
there is no full stop after the last bullet point
Bullets should normally form a complete sentence following from the lead text. But it’s sometimes necessary to add a short phrase to clarify whether all or some of the points apply. For example, ‘You can only register a pension scheme that is (one of the following):’

The number and type of examples in a list may lead the user to believe the list is exhaustive. This can be dealt with by:

checking if there are other conditions (or if the list is actually complete)
listing the conditions which apply to the most users and removing the rest
consider broader terms in the list which capture more scenarios (and could make the list exhaustive)
creating a journey to specialist content to cover the remaining conditions
Steps
Use numbered steps instead of bullet points to guide a user through a process. You do not need a lead-in line and you can use links and downloads (with appropriate Markdown) in steps. Steps end in a full stop because each should be a complete sentence.

## money
Use the £ symbol: £75

Do not use decimals unless pence are included: £75.50 but not £75.00

Do not use ‘£0.xx million’ for amounts less than £1 million.

Write out pence in full: calls will cost 4 pence per minute from a landline.

Currencies are lower case.

## Capitalisation
DO NOT USE BLOCK CAPITALS FOR LARGE AMOUNTS OF TEXT AS IT’S QUITE HARD TO READ.

Always use lower case, even in page titles. The exceptions to this are proper nouns, including:

departments (specific government departments - see below)
the Civil Service, with lower case for ‘the’
specific job titles
titles like Mr, Mrs, Dr, the Duke of Cambridge (the duke at second mention); Pope Francis, but the pope
Rt Hon (no full stops)
buildings
place names
brand names
faculties, departments, institutes and schools
names of groups, directorates and organisations: Knowledge and Innovation Group
Parliament, the House
titles of specific acts or bills: Housing Reform Bill (but use ‘the act’ or ‘the bill’ after the first time you use the full act or bill title)
names of specific, named government schemes known to people outside government: Right to Buy, Queen’s Awards for Enterprise
specific select committees: Public Administration Select Committee
header cells in tables: Annual profits
titles of books (and within single quotes), for example, ‘The Study Skills Handbook’
World War 1 and World War 2 (note caps and numbers)
Do not capitalise:
government - see government
minister, never Minister, unless part of a specific job title, like Minister for the Cabinet Office
department or ministry - never Department or Ministry, unless referring to a specific one: Ministry of Justice, for example
white paper, green paper, command paper, House of Commons paper
budget, autumn statement, spring statement, unless referring to and using the full name of a specific statement - for example, “2016 Budget”
sections or schedules within specific named acts, regulations or orders
director general (no hyphen), deputy director, director, unless in a specific job title
group and directorate, unless referring to a specific group or directorate: the Commercial Directorate, for example
departmental board, executive board, the board
policy themes like sustainable communities, promoting economic growth, local enterprise zones
general mention of select committees (but do cap specific ones - see above)
the military

## Capitals for government departments
Use the following conventions for government departments. A department using an ampersand in its logo image is fine but use ‘and’ when writing in full text.

Attorney General’s Office (AGO)
Cabinet Office (CO)
Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS)
Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS)
Department for Education (DfE)
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU)
Department for International Development (DFID)
Department for International Trade (DIT)
Department for Transport (DfT)
Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)
Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC)
Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO)
HM Treasury (HMT)
Home Office (HO)
Ministry of Defence (MOD)
Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG)
Ministry of Justice (MOJ)

## Contractions
Avoid negative contractions like can’t and don’t. Many users find them harder to read, or misread them as the opposite of what they say. Use cannot, instead of can’t.

Avoid should’ve, could’ve, would’ve, they’ve too. These can also be hard to read.

## Dates
use upper case for months: January, February
do not use a comma between the month and year: 4 June 2017
when space is an issue - in tables or publication titles, for example - you can use truncated months: Jan, Feb
we use ‘to’ in date ranges - not hyphens, en rules or em dashes. For example:
tax year 2011 to 2012
Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm (put different days on a new line, do not separate with a comma)
10 November to 21 December
do not use quarter for dates, use the months: ‘department expenses, Jan to Mar 2013’
when referring to today (as in a news article) include the date: ‘The minister announced today (14 June 2012) that…’
Read more about dates.

## Latin: eg, etc and ie
eg can sometimes be read aloud as ‘egg’ by screen reading software. Instead use ‘for example’ or ‘such as’ or ‘like’ or ‘including’ - whichever works best in the specific context.

etc can usually be avoided. Try using ‘for example’ or ‘such as’ or ‘like’ or ‘including’. Never use etc at the end of a list starting with these words.

ie - used to clarify a sentence - is not always well understood. Try (re)writing sentences to avoid the need to use it. If that is not possible, use an alternative such as ‘meaning’ or ‘that is’.

## Hyphenation
Hyphenate:

re- words starting with e, like re-evaluate
co-ordinate
co-operate
Do not hyphenate:

reuse
reinvent
reorder
reopen
email
Do not use a hyphen unless it’s confusing without it, for example, a little used-car is different from a little-used car. You can also refer to The Guardian style guide for advice on hyphenation.

Use ‘to’ for time and date ranges, not hyphens.

## Links
Front-load your link text with the relevant terms and make them active and specific. Always link to online services first. Offer offline alternatives afterwards, when possible.

## Lists
Lists should be bulleted to make them easier to read. See bullets and steps.

Very long lists can be written as a paragraph with a lead-in sentence if it looks better: ‘The following countries are in the EU: Spain, France, Italy…’

## Numbers
Use ‘one’ unless you’re talking about a step, a point in a list or another situation where using the numeral makes more sense: ‘in point 1 of the design instructions’, for example. Or this:

You’ll be shown 14 clips that feature everyday road scenes.

There will be:

1 developing hazard in 13 clips
2 developing hazards in the other clip
Write all other numbers in numerals (including 2 to 9) except where it’s part of a common expression like ‘one or two of them’ where numerals would look strange.

If a number starts a sentence, write it out in full (Thirty-four, for example) except where it starts a title or subheading.

For numerals over 999 - insert a comma for clarity: 9,000

Spell out common fractions like one-half.

Use a % sign for percentages: 50%

Use a 0 where there’s no digit before the decimal point.

Use ‘500 to 900’ and not ‘500-900’ (except in tables).

Use MB for anything over 1MB: 4MB not 4096KB.

Use KB for anything under 1MB: 569KB not 0.55MB.

Keep it as accurate as possible and up to 2 decimal places: 4.03MB.

Addresses: use ‘to’ in address ranges: 49 to 53 Cherry Street.

Ordinal numbers
Spell out first to ninth. After that use 10th, 11th and so on.

In tables, use numerals throughout.

## online services
Lower case if the service name starts with a verb - write the sentence so the user knows what action they can take. For example: You can visit someone in prison by booking online.

Only use upper case if the name of the service you’re referring to contains named thing. For example: You can apply for Marriage Allowance.

## Quotes and speech marks
In long passages of speech, open quotes for every new paragraph, but close quotes only at the end of the final paragraph.

Single quotes
Use single quotes:

in headlines
for unusual terms
when referring to words or publications, for example: ‘Download the publication ‘Understanding Capital Gains Tax’ (PDF, 360KB)’
Double quotes
Use double quotes in body text for direct quotations.

Block quotes
Use the block quote Markdown for quotes longer than a few sentences.

## semicolons
Do not use semicolons as they are often mis-read. Long sentences using semicolons should be broken up into separate sentences instead.

## Sentence length
Do not use long sentences. Check sentences with more than 25 words to see if you can split them to make them clearer.

Read more about short sentences.

## Times
use ‘to’ in time ranges, not hyphens, en rules or em dashes: 10am to 11am (not 10-11am)
5:30pm (not 1730hrs)
midnight (not 00:00)
midday (not 12 noon, noon or 12pm)
6 hours 30 minutes
Midnight is the first minute of the day, not the last. You should consider using “11:59pm” to avoid confusion about a single, specific time.

For example, “You must register by 11:59pm on Tuesday 14 June.” can only be read one way, but “You must register by midnight on Tuesday 14 June” can be read in two ways (the end of Monday 13, or end of Tuesday 14).

## Titles
Page titles should:

be 65 characters or less
be unique, clear and descriptive
be front-loaded and optimised for search
use a colon to break up longer titles
not contain dashes or slashes
not have a full stop at the end
not use acronyms unless they are well-known, like EU
town council
Lower case, even when part of a name: Swanage town council.

## Words to avoid
Plain English is mandatory for all of GOV.UK so please avoid using these words:

agenda (unless it’s for a meeting)
advancing
collaborate (use working with)
combating
commit/pledge (we need to be more specific - we’re either doing something or we’re not)
countering
deliver (pizzas, post and services are delivered - not abstract concepts like improvements or priorities)
deploy (unless it’s military or software)
dialogue (we speak to people)
disincentivise (and incentivise)
empower
facilitate (instead, say something specific about how you’re helping)
focusing
foster (unless it’s children)
impact (do not use this as a synonym for have an effect on, or influence)
initiate
key (unless it unlocks something. A subject/thing is not key - it’s probably important)
land (as a verb only use if you’re talking about aircraft)
leverage (unless in the financial sense)
liaise
overarching
progress (as a verb - what are you actually doing?)
promote (unless you’re talking about an ad campaign or some other marketing promotion)
robust
slimming down (processes do not diet)
streamline
strengthening (unless it’s strengthening bridges or other structures)
tackling (unless it’s rugby, football or some other sport)
transforming (what are you actually doing to change it?)
utilise
Avoid using metaphors – they do not say what you actually mean and lead to slower comprehension of your content. For example:

drive (you can only drive vehicles, not schemes or people)
drive out (unless it’s cattle)
going forward (it’s unlikely we are giving travel directions)
in order to (superfluous - do not use it)
one-stop shop (we are government, not a retail outlet)
ring fencing
With all of these words you can generally replace them by breaking the term into what you’re actually doing. Be open and specific.
