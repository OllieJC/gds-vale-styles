# TLAs in headings are wrong

## MTV in a heading is also wrong

FND at the beginning of a line is bad.

It's bad to have WER in the middle of a line.

Should also not end in QWER.

Between brackets [SDF] is bad even if it's a link.

Having [link label][ASDF] is also not fine.

Must also pick up acronyms with numbers 2LA for example.

The smallest ones like SP should also be explained.

Three letter acronyms Zombie Xander with Chariot (ZXC) must be explained.

Turns out ZXC is awesome.
